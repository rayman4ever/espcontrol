espcontrol README

A small webserver for home control based on esp-httpd featuring simple authorization system and time-based tasks.  

Server Features:
 - Control GPIO for now :D 
 - MAC address whitelist control
 - Time based tasks (WIP)
 - Multi-Server Communication (WIP)

Building Instructions:
  1- Follow esp-httpd building instructions
  2- Don't forget to change the "ESP8266_ROOT_PATH" in Makefile
  3- "make" to build everything (firmware + html pages)

Flashing Instructions:
  - Change "ESPPORT" in Makefile to point to the correct uart adapter you have 
  You have the following options:
  	- "make flash" : will flash the firmware only
	- "make flashhtml" : will flash the html pages only
	- "make flashall" : will flash the firmware and the html pages

Please notice the following:
 - html pages size shouldn't exceed 180KB
 - config is stored in flash at sector 0x3F (sector size = 4KB each)

Special thanks to "Sprite_tm" for the great "esp-httpd"
